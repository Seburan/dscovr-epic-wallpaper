Tools for fetching NASA's DSCOVR: EPIC Earth pictures and set your Windows desktop wallpaper.

NASA EPIC::DSCOVR Project : https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov

Based on API Version 2.0 : https://epic.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/api

NASA's DSCOVR: EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) project is publishing every day a dozen pictures of earth (2-3 days back)
I thought it could be fun to refresh my Windows Desktop Wallpaper using the latests images published, using the image matching current time/position of earth towards the sun.
Basically at 00:00 UTC West Pacific is facing sun, 12:00 UTC western Europe is facing Sun, and 23:00 UTC east pacific is facing sun.
If you want the same setup, configure you Windows scheduler to run hourly with the following parameters or use the sample batch file in the project.
